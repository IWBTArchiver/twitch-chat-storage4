So great, that it carried me to sub 30 even with a bad final two stages. I&#39;m super surprised and pleased that I pulled the sub 30, but I&#39;m in no way overly-impressed with the run itself. Sub 29:30 is my new goal, and I think it&#39;s a reasonable time.","chapters":[{"id":"","startMilliseconds":0,"lengthMilliseconds":2294000,"type":"GAME_CHANGE","description":"Unknown","subDescription":"","thumbnailUrl":null,"gameId":"-1","gameDisplayName":"Unknown","gameBoxArtUrl":""}],"streamer":{"name":"GeoGeo222","login":"geogeo222","id":40531267}},"embedded_data":{"twitch_badges":{}},"messages":[]}
